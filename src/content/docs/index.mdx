Thank you for your interest in sponsoring Modtoberfest! We have put this page together as an in-depth guide to
sponsoring the event.

## What is Modtoberfest?
Modtoberfest is an annual celebration of open source in the Minecraft community. During October we challenge members of
the community to create at least 4 pull requests to participating projects. Those who complete this challenge before the
end of the month will be rewarded with a sticker pack featuring designs contributed by sponsors of the event.
Modtoberfest is organized by [Darkhax](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkhaxdev/projects) and [Jaredlll08](https://www.curseforge.com/members/jaredlll08/projects), and is inspired by events such as
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

## Who can sponsor?
While anyone is welcome to sponsor Modtoberfest, we are specifically looking for companies, projects, organizations, and
individuals that are directly involved in the Minecraft community. If you're interested, please reach out on
[Discord](https://discord.modtoberfest.com)!

## Why should I sponsor?
Sponsoring Modtoberfest is a great way to engage with the Minecraft developer community. Our sponsors are listed on the
sponsors page and will be able to link an image, a website, and some social links. Sponsors will also be able to
highlight repositories on the repo list. This will make them visually distinct and give them better placement on our
participating projects list. **Sponsoring is not required to be included in the participating projects list!**

## How do I sponsor?
Sponsoring Modtoberfest is pretty simple, the only requirement is that you contribute something to the sticker pack that
is sent out to participants. There are several ways to do this, but it can be as simple as sending us a PNG and some
money on PayPal.

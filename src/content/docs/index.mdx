Thank you for your interest in sponsoring Modtoberfest! This website provides useful information and guides for those
who are sponsoring the event.

## What is Modtoberfest?
Modtoberfest is an annual celebration of open source in the Minecraft community! During October we challenge
participants to make at least 4 pull requests to participating projects. Those who complete this challenge before the
end of the month are rewarded with a sticker pack featuring designs contributed by sponsors of the event! Modtoberfest
is organized by [Darkhax](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkhaxdev/projects) and
[Jaredlll08](https://www.curseforge.com/members/jaredlll08/projects), and is inspired by events such as Hacktoberfest.

## Who Can Sponsor?
While anyone is welcome to sponsor Modtoberfest, we are specifically looking for companies, projects, organizations, and
individuals that are directly involved in the Minecraft community. If you're interested in sponsoring, please reach out
to us on Discord!

## Why Should I Sponsor?
Sponsoring Modtoberfest is a great way to engage with the modded Minecraft community. Sponsors are listed on the
sponsors page and will be able to link an image, a website, and some social links. Sponsors will also be able to
highlight repositories on the repo list. This will make them visually distinct and give them more prominent placing on
the list.

## Is sponsoring required for my project to participate?
No, any Minecraft project on GitHub is allowed to submit their repo to our list of participating projects. You only need
to sponsor if you want to include a sticker in the sticker pack or have your projects promoted.

## How to Sponsor?
Sponsoring Modtoberfest is pretty simple, the only requirement is that you provide something to include in the sticker
pack that is sent out to participants. There are several ways to do this, and we aim to make this as easy and affordable
as possible.

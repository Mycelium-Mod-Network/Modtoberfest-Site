We are now allowing sponsors to contribute digital rewards. These will show up on a participants profile once they 
complete the event. Past examples include redeemable codes that unlock a cosmetic in your mod. If you are interested, 
please keep the following things in mind.

- A physical reward is still required. We've made this easier than ever with our in-house stickers!
- There must be enough digital rewards for all participants to claim.
- No discount codes, NFTs, or block-chain assets.
- The digital reward must not violate Mojang's terms of service or EULA.
- The code must not expire for at least one year after the event.

## FaQ

### How do I provide the digital rewards?
Our system currently requires you to provide us with a list of codes in advance. We will then distribute these codes
from our database when a participant completes the challenge.

### Why is a physical reward still required?
While digital rewards are cool and appreciated, they push the boundary of what is within the spirit of the event. This 
requirement ensures that all sponsors have some connection to the physical sticker pack we ship out.

### Why do you not allow discount codes?
Modtoberfest is not a platform for advertising services, and we do not want it to become one. While some level of 
advertisement is inherent to any sponsorship, directly tying the reward to a service crosses a line for us. Our 
participants have also given feedback indicating they see discount codes as spam.

### Why are NFTs and Crypto assets not allowed?
While there may be some legitimate uses for NFTs or Crypto assets, it is undeniable that these communities are 
associated with fraud, crime, and scams. We do not wish to be associated with these things or have them be part of our 
event.

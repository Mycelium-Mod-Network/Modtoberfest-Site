            <Item title = "What is Modtoberfest?">
                Modtoberfest is a celebration of open source projects in the Minecraft community. During October we challenge the community
                to give back to the open source projects at the heart of our community by contributing pull requests. Those who submit four
                valid pull requests to participating <a href = "/repositories">community projects</a> will be eligible to receive a
                free prize pack including stickers and pins designed by the sponsors of the event. You can <a href="/auth/github">sign up</a> any

            <Item title = "What is open source?">
                Open source projects allow anyone to view or modify their source code. These projects are very important to the community as
                they are great resources for learning and encourage collaboration within the community. Open source projects build the
                foundation of many communities, including the Minecraft community.
            </Item>

            <Item title = "What is a pull request?">
                Pull requests are a popular way to submit your changes to a project. This allows a maintainer of the project to review your
                changes. If your changes are approved they can be merged, allowing them to benefit from your work. Creating pull requests is
                a great way to give back to an open source project.
            </Item>
